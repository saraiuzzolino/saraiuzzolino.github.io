## Personal Introduction
theme:dinky
  My name is Sara Iuzzolino and I am a sophomore and I attend Lehigh University. I am originally from Chatham, New Jersey, which is about an hour east of Lehigh. I have a twin brother named Nate and I have a dog named Harper. At Lehigh, I am a declared journalism major, and I plan on pursueing a second major in marketing. I decided to pursue journalism mostly because of my interest in sports journalism, my dream job is to work as a reporter/writer for a professional sports team, specifically for Major League Baseball. My interest in this kind of reporting stems from my love for sports and my passion for writing. Growing up, I was always involved with sports (such as softball, volleyball, and soccer), and when I was not playing sports, I was watching them with my family. I decided to attend Lehigh University because of its award winning newspaper, [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). 

During my first semester at Lehigh, I started as an entry level reporter for the sports beat on The Brown and White. I immediatly fell in love with writing for the paper, and I knew that I wanted to take on an elevated role on the paper. Then, my second semester I became an associate-editor for the news section. At first, I did not love writing for news, but after I got some practice I learned to love it, and it gave me great experience outside of sports writing. Now, I am an associate editor for the sports section, which has been extremely enjoyable so far. My most recent article was about [Lehigh's Track and Field team's coaching staff changes](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/09/07/track-and-field-teams-make-significant-changes-to-coaching-staff/).
