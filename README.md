## Introduction
  My name is Sara Iuzzolino and I am a sophomore and I attend Lehigh University. I am originally from Chatham, New Jersey, which is about an hour east of Lehigh. I have a twin brother named Nate and I have a dog named Harper. At Lehigh, I am a declared journalism major, and I plan on pursueing a second major in marketing. I decided to pursue journalism mostly because of my interest in sports journalism, my dream job is to work as a reporter/writer for a professional sports team, specifically for Major League Baseball. My interest in this kind of reporting stems from my love for sports and my passion for writing. Growing up, I was always involved with sports (like softball, volleyball, and soccer), and when I was not playing sports, I was watching them with my family. I decided to attend Lehigh University because of its award winning newspaper, [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). 
My first semester at Lehigh, I started as an entry level reporter for The Brown and White.
