## Personal Introduction

  My name is Sara Iuzzolino and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University. I am originally from Chatham, New Jersey, which is about an hour east of Lehigh. I have a twin brother named Nate and I have a dog named Harper. At Lehigh, I am a declared journalism major, and I plan on pursuing a second major in marketing. I decided to pursue journalism mostly because of my interest in sports journalism. My dream career is to work as a reporter/writer for a professional sports team, specifically for a Major League Baseball team. My interest in sports reporting stems from my love for sports and my passion for writing. Growing up, I was always involved with sports (such as softball, volleyball, and soccer), and when I was not playing sports, I was watching them with my family. I decided to attend Lehigh University because of its award winning newspaper, [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). I hoped that the experience working on the newspaper would help me get closer to achieving my career goals. 

During my first semester at Lehigh, I started as an entry level reporter for the sports beat on The Brown and White. I immediatly fell in love with writing for the paper, and I knew that I wanted to take on an elevated role on the paper. Then, during my second semester, I became an associate editor for the news section. At first, I writing for the news section was challenging, but after I got some practice I learned to love it, and it gave me great experience outside of sports writing. Now, I am an associate editor for the sports section, which has been extremely enjoyable so far. My most recent article was about [Lehigh's Track and Field team's coaching staff changes](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/09/07/track-and-field-teams-make-significant-changes-to-coaching-staff/).

##  Global Prevalance of Celiac Disease Infographic 
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the prevalence of Celiac Disease in the population of each continent of the world. This data is from [The Celiac Foundation](https://celiac.org/about-the-foundation/featured-news/2018/08/global-prevalence-of-celiac-disease/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20meta,0.8%25%20in%20Europe%20and%20Oceania.). I chose to research this topic because I have Celiac Disease, and I was curious as to how many people worldwide are affected by it. In order to access this data, I started with a general search on Google, which brought me to The Celiac Foundation website, which I identified as a reliable data source for this topic. According to this data, 0.7% of the global population has Celiac Disease, and it is most commonly diagnosed in Europe and Oceania (where 0.8% of the population has Celiac Disease).
