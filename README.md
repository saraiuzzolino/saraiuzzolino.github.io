## Personal Introduction

  My name is Sara Iuzzolino and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University. I am originally from Chatham, New Jersey, which is about an hour east of Lehigh. I have a twin brother named Nate and I have a dog named Harper. At Lehigh, I am a declared journalism major, and I plan on pursuing a second major in marketing. I decided to pursue journalism mostly because of my interest in sports journalism. My dream career is to work as a reporter/writer for a professional sports team, specifically for a Major League Baseball team. My interest in sports reporting stems from my love for sports and my passion for writing. Growing up, I was always involved with sports (such as softball, volleyball, and soccer), and when I was not playing sports, I was watching them with my family. I decided to attend Lehigh University because of its award winning newspaper, [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). I hoped that the experience working on the newspaper would help me get closer to achieving my career goals. 

During my first semester at Lehigh, I started as an entry level reporter for the sports beat on The Brown and White. I immediatly fell in love with writing for the paper, and I knew that I wanted to take on an elevated role on the paper. Then, during my second semester, I became an associate editor for the news section. At first, I writing for the news section was challenging, but after I got some practice I learned to love it, and it gave me great experience outside of sports writing. Now, I am an associate editor for the sports section, which has been extremely enjoyable so far. My most recent article was about [Lehigh's Track and Field team's coaching staff changes](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/09/07/track-and-field-teams-make-significant-changes-to-coaching-staff/).

This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the Undergraduate Residence data at Lehigh University during the fall of 2019. The data is from the [Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf) at Lehigh University. This data shows that a majority of students live in on-campus residence halls and off-campus, with a small percentage living in sorority and fraternity residences. 

##  Global Prevalance of Celiac Disease Infographic 

![image](https://github.com/saraiuzzolino/saraiuzzolino.github.io/blob/main/Celiac%20Infographic%20.png?raw=true) 

This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the prevalence of Celiac Disease in the population of each continent of the world. This data is from [The Celiac Foundation](https://celiac.org/about-the-foundation/featured-news/2018/08/global-prevalence-of-celiac-disease/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20meta,0.8%25%20in%20Europe%20and%20Oceania.). I chose to research this topic because I have Celiac Disease, and I was curious as to how many people worldwide are affected by it. In order to access this data, I started with a general search on Google, which brought me to The Celiac Foundation website, which I identified as a reliable data source for this topic. According to this data, 0.7% of the global population has Celiac Disease, and it is most commonly diagnosed in Europe and Oceania (where 0.8% of the population has Celiac Disease). 

## Lehigh vs. Lafayette Football Rivalry Timeline

This timeline was created using information presented during class. The graphic takes the reader through a history of one of college football's greatest rivalries: Lehigh vs. Lafayette. The teams have faced each other every year for over 150 years, so naturally there have been many unforgettable moments, which are highlighted in the timeline that I have created. 

## Jonas Brothers Reunion Timeline

This timeline was creating using information from the Insider article [From 'Year 3000' to 'Sucker,' here's how the Jonas Brothers' careers have evolved](https://www.insider.com/the-jonas-brothers-career-timeline-2019-3). The Jonas Brothers have been my favorite band since I was a little girl, and since they have such a unique story about breaking up and reuniting years later, I thought they would be an interesting group to make a timeline about. This graphic takes the reader through the highs and the lows of the groups success, inlcluding how they got their start and how they ended up coming back together in 2019. 

## Lehigh University First-Year Enrollment Chart 
![image](https://github.com/saraiuzzolino/saraiuzzolino.github.io/blob/main/First-Year_Undergraduate_Enrollment_By_College_at_Lehigh_University_Undergraduate_Enrollment__chartbuilder.png?raw=true)
This data is from from [Lehigh's Fall 2021 institutional profile](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf). According to this data, the majority of students at Lehigh are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. This finding was no surprising to me since this college offers the most wide variety of majors, so it makes sense that 44% of the student body is enrolled in the college. Furthermore, the College of Engineering had the second highest enrollment percentage, which I thought made sense since Lehigh is know for being an engineering school. 

## Percentage of Lehigh Undergradutes Involved in Greek Life Per Year Chart 
![image](https://github.com/saraiuzzolino/saraiuzzolino.github.io/blob/main/Percentage_of_Undergraduate_Students_Involved_in_Greek_Life_at_Lehigh_Percentage_of_Greek_Undergraduates__chartbuilder%20(1).png?raw=true)
  From this data I was able to conclude that about one third of the Lehigh student body has been involved in Greek Life during any given year over the past five years. It was also evident that the percentage of students involved in Greek Life at Lehigh University has remained relatively consistent over the past five years. This is because the range of the data is only 3.9%. In the chart, it appears that Greek Life participation at Lehigh was at its lowest in 2020 (29.6%), however, since then there has been an upward trend in participation. This made me wonder if the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on Greek Life involvement on Lehigh's campus. Overall, this data illustrated the significance of Greek Life's presence at Lehigh Univeristy. This data was collected from Lehigh's [Fraternity & Sorority Statistics and Trends Analysis](https://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/sites/studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/files/offices/ofsa/docs/trendanalysis/Statistics%20and%20Trend%20Report%20S22.pdf).   
  
 
  ## GDP Per Capita (by thousands) vs. Life Satisfaction Chart 
  ![image](https://github.com/saraiuzzolino/saraiuzzolino.github.io/blob/main/GDP_Per_Capita_(by_thousands)_vs._Life_Satisfaction__Life_satisfaction_in_Cantril_Ladder_(World_Happiness_Report_2019)_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)
  Before looking at my chart, it is crucial to understand that the GDP per capita is by thousands (I had to simplify the numbers in the chart for aesthetic purposes). This chart indicates that there is somewhat of a correlation between GDP per capita and life satisfaction. In my chart, it seems that if an individual has a higher GDP per capita, they also have a higher life satisfcation. While this is not a perfect correlation, it is definitely something of note. There is one clear outlier in the data set and I am curious as to why this is the case. This data was collected from the [2017 Life Satisfaction and GDP per capita dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GqouSzpED6AiwiO778FcIerDmM27A0sXcteGO7Dvad8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Acceptace Rate by Year at Lehigh University Chart 
![image](https://github.com/saraiuzzolino/saraiuzzolino.github.io/blob/main/Acceptance_Rate_by_Year_at_Lehigh_University__Acceptance_Rate__chartbuilder%20(1).png?raw=true)
For this project, I decided to research how the acceptance rate of admission into Lehigh has changed over the years since I have heard rumors that the university is trying to expand. In order to acquire this data, I consulted Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics, and I was able to retrieve data dating back to 2010. This data shows a downward trend from 2010 (37.9%) to 2018 (22.3%), except for in 2014 where there was a slight increase in the acceptance rate. The chart also illustrates a drastic increase in acceptance rate from 22.3% in 2018 to 49.5% in 2020. I thought this was really interesting and it made me wonder if the COVID-19 pandemic had any impact on the rates of acceptance at Lehigh. Since the acceptance rate at Lehigh has increased dramatically in recent years, I can conclude that it is likely that the university is expanding since they are accepting many more students than they have in the past. This data was collecte from Lehigh's [Office of Institutional Research & Strategical Analytics' Incoming Class Summaries](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/incoming-class-summaries).  

## Top 20 Cycling Countries Map

This map illustrates the top 20 cycling countries in the world. According to this data, a majority of these top cycling countries are in Europe, which I found extremely interesting. The number one ranked country for cycling in the world is Denmark, where approximately 62% of the population bike to work/school. Overall, this data made me curious as to why biking seems to be much more prominent in European culture than in other continents. This data was collected from [Wired's The 20 Most Bike-Friendly Cities on the Planet, Ranked](The 20 Most Bike-Friendly Cities on the Planet, Ranked). 

## Top 10 Travel Destinations for Celiacs Map 
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1qdgM0v0S0CcUtadL5OA_YEuFImI8TjQ&ehbc=2E312F" width="640" height="480"></iframe> 

For this project, I decided to create a map of the most Celiac friendly travel destinations using data from Wheatless Wanderlust's [10 Best Gluten Free Travel Destinations for Celiac Travelers](https://wheatlesswanderlust.com/best-gluten-free-travel-destinations/). I decided to research this topic because as someone who was recently diagnosed with Celiac, I was curious to know how it would affect my traveling. I have always been interested in studying abroad during college, but after my Celiac diagnosis I was not sure that this would be possible. After creating this map, it became clear that it is possible to travel all over the world and enjoy gluten free food! I was particularly surprised to see Rome was ranked number two on the list. This was surprising to me because Italy is known for bread, pasta, and pizza, but I am excited to hear that they have many gluten free options available for Celiacs since I love Italy. I was also surprised to see New York City only ranked as number five since I have traveled there many times and they always have a multitude of gluten free options.

For this project, I used the platform Tableau to create two interactive visualizations with data regarding Lehigh's party scene that was collected by a survey created by Lehigh students. In my first visualization, I created a bar chart that expresses the gender difference in party location preferences. From this data, we can conclude that females prefer off campus parties, while males prefer parties at the on campus fraternity houses. The second visualization illustrates the gender difference in the party location's impact on the likeliness of attendence. From this data, we are able to conclude that females are more likely to attend a party at Lehigh when it is off campus, while males are more likely to attend a party that is at an on campus fraternity house.
